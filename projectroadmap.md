1: Find existing Python code related to your project, run code, and document what you learned (Sprint 1) -- DONE

2: Clone/Download existing project into your repository and on your personal machine-- DONE

3: Begin constructing project layout by listing all variables that need to be filled-- DONE

4: Begin coding by programming all print and input options pre-calculation-- DONE

5: Initialize all necessary variable placeholders and code for string-to-float conversions--DONE

6: Create the first decision trees (for yes/no questions) and add code to change related variables when necessary--DONE

7: Add code to check each input for valid options and prompt users to re-enter input if invalid--DONE

8: Create decision trees used for calculating the basic bolus formula with no physical factors

9: Create remaining needed decision trees and/or update existing ones to account for physical factors

10: Merge decision trees to create an easier to read program, add loops if necessary

11: Compare project with similar projects to explore options for improving the program

12: Add any small final touches or fix any errors

13: Final code test (test at least 3 different scenarios)
